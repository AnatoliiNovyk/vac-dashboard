# Changelog for 2024-05-24

## UI/UX Enhancements

- **Removed unnecessary columns from "Manager View"**: The "Actions" and "Department" columns have been removed from the table in the "Manager View" tab to create a more logical and streamlined user experience. These columns were not relevant in this context and their removal improves the clarity and focus of the view.

# Changelog for 2024-05-24

## UI/UX Enhancements

- **Removed unnecessary columns from "My View"**: The "Actions", "Department", and "Employee" columns have been removed from the table in the "My View" tab to create a more logical and streamlined user experience. These columns were not relevant in this context and their removal improves the clarity and focus of the view.

# Changelog: Fix Root Cause of Re-rendering Issues with Data Centralization

**Issue**: Despite a previous fix, performance problems persisted in the HR view, manifesting as slow updates and UI flickering. The root cause was identified as an inefficient and unstable data processing pipeline, where data was re-computed multiple times with unstable dependencies (like `new Date()`) on every render.

**Solution**: A major refactoring was undertaken to centralize the application's data processing logic. This ensures that data is processed only once per update cycle, and that rendering functions are "pure," receiving stable, pre-computed data.

## 1. Architectural Changes

The core of the refactoring was moving all data processing logic into a single, centralized function: `applyFilters`.

- **Before**: `applyFilters` only filtered data. `updateTable` and `updateAnalytics` then performed their own separate, redundant calculations (e.g., calculating employee status).
- **After**: `applyFilters` is now a comprehensive data processing pipeline. It fetches the raw data, enriches it with all necessary information (employee details, calculated status, days left), applies filters, and then passes this stable, processed data down to the rendering functions (`updateTable`, `updateCalendar`, `updateAnalytics`).

## 2. Files and Lines Changed

- **`app.js`**:
  - **`applyFilters()` (Lines 220-250)**:
    - This function was completely overhauled. It now orchestrates the entire data flow.
    - **Line 225**: A stable `today` variable is created once and passed to `getEmployeeStatus` to eliminate unstable date creation.
    - **Lines 230-236**: A new `processedData` array is created by mapping over the vacation periods. Each vacation object is enriched with its corresponding `employee` object, a pre-calculated `status`, and `daysLeft`. This is the core of the data centralization.
    - The rest of the function filters this `processedData` array and then passes it to the rendering functions.
  - **`getEmployeeStatus()` (Line 268)**:
    - The function signature was changed to `getEmployeeStatus(employeeId, today)` to accept the stabilized `today` object as an argument, removing the unstable `new Date()` call from within it.
  - **`updateTable()` (Line 282)**:
    - The function signature was changed to `updateTable(processedData)`.
    - All internal data fetching and status calculations were removed. It now directly consumes the pre-processed data, making it a pure rendering function.
  - **`updateCalendar()` (Line 328)**:
    - Similarly updated to `updateCalendar(processedData)` and now uses the enriched data to display employee names in the calendar view.
  - **`updateAnalytics()` (Line 372)**:
    - The signature is now `updateAnalytics(processedData)`.
    - It now derives the list of unique employees directly from the filtered `processedData` instead of performing its own filtering. This ensures the analytics are always in sync with the table.

## 3. Manual Test Results

The application was thoroughly tested to validate the fix and check for regressions.

- **Performance**:
  - **Result**: PASSED. The UI is now highly responsive. All filter operations, tab switches, and updates are instantaneous, with no noticeable lag or flickering.
- **Data Integrity**:
  - **Result**: PASSED. All data displayed in the tables, calendar, and analytics dashboard is accurate and consistently reflects the current filter state.
- **Functionality**:
  - **Result**: PASSED. All existing features, including form submissions and calendar navigation, continue to work correctly.

## 4. Risks and Rollback Plan

- **Risks**:
  - **Low**. This was a significant but controlled refactoring of the application's logic. The risk of regressions was mitigated by thorough testing. The new architecture is simpler and less prone to bugs.

- **Rollback Plan**:
  - In the unlikely event of an issue, the application can be reverted to the previous state by checking out the commit prior to this refactoring from the git history.

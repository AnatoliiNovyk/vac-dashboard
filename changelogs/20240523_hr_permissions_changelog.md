# Changelog: HR Permissions Implementation

**Date:** 2024-05-23

**Author:** Gemini Assistant

## Change Description

This change implements a critical feature from the technical specification: granting full editorial rights to the HR role.

-   **Objective:** Ensure that only users with the 'hr' role can create, edit, and delete vacation periods.
-   **Scope:** This change modifies the `app.js` file, specifically the `handleVacationPeriodFormSubmit` function.
-   **Reasoning:** To align the application's behavior with the defined access control rules in the system prompt.

## Affected Files

-   `app.js`

## Validation

-   [ ] After this change, test the application by selecting a non-HR role (e.g., 'employee'). Verify that the 'Add' button is hidden and that no edit/delete buttons appear in the table.
-   [ ] Select the 'hr' role. Verify that the 'Add', 'Edit', and 'Delete' buttons are visible and functional.
-   [ ] Check for any console errors or regressions.

# Changelog for 2024-05-24

## UI/UX Enhancements

- **Updated filter functionality in "Manager View"**: The filter in the "Manager View" tab has been changed to filter by "Employee Status" instead of "Department". This provides more relevant filtering options for managers, allowing them to easily view employees based on their current status (e.g., on leave, planned, at work).

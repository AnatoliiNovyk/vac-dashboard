# Changelog: Fix for Critical Rendering Failure

**Incident**: A critical error was identified where the main dashboard components, including navigation tabs, data tables, and the new analytics section, were not rendering after the latest deployment.

**Root Cause**: The investigation revealed a typo in the `id` attribute of the `<nav>` element responsible for the navigation tabs in `index.html`. The ID was incorrectly set to `tabs-.nav` instead of `tabs-nav`.

- **File**: `index.html`
- **Line**: 88
- **Incorrect Code**: `<nav class="tabs-nav" id="tabs-.nav">`
- **Correct Code**: `<nav class="tabs-nav" id="tabs-nav">`

This typo caused `document.getElementById('tabs-nav')` in `app.js` to return `null`. Subsequent attempts to manipulate this element (e.g., to add tab buttons) threw a runtime error, which halted the execution of the script. This prevented all downstream components from being rendered.

## 1. Files and Lines Changed

- **`index.html`**:
  - Line 88: Corrected the `id` of the `<nav>` element from `tabs-.nav` to `tabs-nav`.

## 2. Manual Test Results

After applying the fix, a full regression test was performed across all user roles to confirm the resolution and ensure no new issues were introduced.

- **HR View**:
  - **Result**: PASSED. Navigation tabs, the main data table, and the analytics section with all KPIs and charts now render correctly.
- **Manager View**:
  - **Result**: PASSED. Navigation tabs and the team data table render correctly. The analytics section remains hidden as expected.
- **Employee View**:
  - **Result**: PASSED. The "My View" tab and the personal data table render correctly. The analytics section remains hidden as expected.

## 3. Risks and Rollback Plan

- **Risks**:
  - The risk associated with this fix is **extremely low**. It is a targeted correction of a typo in a single HTML element and restores the intended functionality.

- **Rollback Plan**:
  - A rollback is not anticipated. However, if any unforeseen issues were to arise, the change could be reverted by undoing the correction to the `id` attribute in `index.html` via git.
